define                   = -DCUSTOMPOSRES -DPOSRES -DPOSRES_FC=5.0 ; will trigger the inclusion of posre.itp into your topology, used for implementing position restraints.
; here we assume that in posres.itp file all force constants have been changed to POSRES_FC
; see this link for details http://mdsquad.wikia.com/wiki/Change_position_restraint_force_constant_in_MDP
;1000 kJ mol-1 nm-2 is the default constant
;to match AMBER we need 100 kcal/mol/A2, which is 418 kJ/mol/A2 - we set 500
